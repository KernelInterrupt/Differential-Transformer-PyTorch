# Differential-Transformer-PyTorch
PyTorch implementation of the Differential-Transformer architecture for sequence modeling, specifically tailored as a decoder-only model similar to large language models (LLMs). The architecture incorporates a novel Differential Attention mechanism, Multi-Head structure, RMSNorm, and SwiGLU.
